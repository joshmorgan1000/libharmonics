# Plugins and Tools
# Plugin System

Harmonics allows custom layers, activations and loss functions to be loaded at runtime.
This is accomplished through the plugin registry found in `include/harmonics/plugin.hpp`.
A plugin is a shared library that exposes a single C-style entry point:

```cpp
extern "C" void harmonics_register(harmonics::FunctionRegistry& reg);
```

Inside this function the plugin receives a `FunctionRegistry` object and registers
any new implementations it wishes to make available. Each type of object is identified
by a string name:

```cpp
reg.register_activation("my_act", std::make_shared<MyActivation>());
reg.register_loss("my_loss", std::make_shared<MyLoss>());
reg.register_layer("my_layer", std::make_shared<MyLayer>());
```

The runtime looks up these names when parsing a graph or when loading weights.
Plugins can therefore override existing functions or supply completely new ones.

## Loading plugins

Use `load_plugin(path)` to load a specific shared library. To load multiple plugins
from a directory tree call `load_plugins_from_path(dir)`. This helper scans all
files named `*.so` (or `*.dll` on Windows) under `dir` and invokes the register
function in each of them.

For convenience the `HARMONICS_PLUGIN_PATH` environment variable can hold a colon
separated list of directories to search. If the variable is set, `load_plugins_from_path()`
will automatically scan the given paths.

```cpp
harmonics::load_plugins_from_path("./plugins");
```

## Discovery mechanism

`load_plugin` simply opens the shared library at the given path and invokes the
`harmonics_register` entry point. For larger setups
`load_plugins_from_path` accepts a colon separated list of directories. Each
directory is scanned recursively for files ending in `.so` (or `.dll` on
Windows). Any libraries found are loaded and missing registration symbols are
ignored so that partially populated trees do not abort startâ€‘up. If the function
is called with an empty string it checks the `HARMONICS_PLUGIN_PATH` environment
variable instead.

The helper returns handles for every successfully loaded plugin. These handles
can later be passed to `unload_plugin` once the plugin is no longer needed.

Asynchronous variants (`load_plugin_async`, `load_plugins_from_path_async` and
`unload_plugin_async`) return `std::future` objects so multiple plugins can be
loaded or unloaded in parallel.

## Unloading plugins

Plugins remain loaded for the lifetime of the process unless explicitly
unloaded. Call `unload_plugin(handle)` when the functionality provided by a
library is no longer required. The registered functions stay in the global
`FunctionRegistry`, so any graphs created after unloading will still resolve the
identifiers. Ensure that no code from the plugin is executing when the library
is closed.

## Runtime registry

Plugins register their implementations with the global `FunctionRegistry`. This
singleton maps string identifiers to activation, loss and layer objects. The
registry is passed to the plugin's `harmonics_register` function and offers the
methods `register_activation`, `register_loss` and `register_layer`. Runtime
lookups use `getActivation`, `getLoss` and `getLayer`.

Registrations override existing entries by default. Starting with version 1.1
all registry operations are protected by a mutex so that multiple plugins can be
loaded concurrently.

## Example project

A simple demonstration plugin lives under `examples/plugin_example`. The project
builds a `sample_plugin` library implementing a custom activation and then loads it
via the `plugin_example` executable. The example shows how to compile and link a
plugin using CMake and how to call `load_plugin()` at runtime.

## Packaging and discovery

Plugins are usually distributed as shared libraries inside a small directory
containing an optional `plugin.json` file. The layout and helper commands are
described in [PluginPackaging.md](PluginPackaging.md). A packed plugin can be
archived with `plugin_packager package` and installed with
`plugin_packager install`. At runtime set `HARMONICS_PLUGIN_PATH` to the root
directory or pass the path to `load_plugins_from_path()` to load all plugins
recursively.

## Hot reloading

Plugins can be updated without restarting the process. Call `reload_plugin(path)`
to unload the existing library at `path` and immediately load the new file. Any
functions previously registered remain available while the updated plugin can
register additional implementations or replace the old ones.

Helpers `reload_plugins_in_directory` and `reload_plugins_from_path` mirror the
load variants and make it easy to refresh entire plugin trees. Asynchronous
versions of all reload APIs are also provided.

## Version metadata

Each plugin may optionally export a `harmonics_plugin_version()` function that
returns an integer identifying the plugin version. When present the loader
records this value in the returned `PluginHandle`. Applications can inspect the
`version` field to ensure compatibility before invoking the plugin's functions.

All load and unload operations are protected by a mutex so plugins can be hot
reloaded safely even when multiple threads are active.

# Plugin System Tutorial

This tutorial walks through creating and loading a simple plugin in Harmonics. Plugins allow you to add custom layers, activations and losses without modifying the core library.

## 1. Create the plugin source

A plugin is a shared library that defines a `harmonics_register` function. Inside this function you register your extensions with the provided `FunctionRegistry`:

```cpp
#include <harmonics/function_registry.hpp>
#include <memory>

struct ExampleActivation : harmonics::ActivationFunction {
    harmonics::HTensor operator()(const harmonics::HTensor& x) const override {
        return x; // identity for demonstration
    }
};

extern "C" void harmonics_register(harmonics::FunctionRegistry& reg) {
    reg.register_activation("example_act", std::make_shared<ExampleActivation>());
}
```

Save the file as `sample_plugin.cpp` and place it in a directory of your choice (the examples directory contains the same file under `examples/plugin_example`).

## 2. Build the plugin

Use CMake to compile the file as a shared library. A minimal `CMakeLists.txt` looks like:

```cmake
cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.16)
project(sample_plugin)

add_library(sample_plugin SHARED sample_plugin.cpp)
```

Configure and build the project:

```bash
cmake -S . -B build
cmake --build build
```

This produces `libsample_plugin.so` (or `sample_plugin.dll` on Windows) in the build directory.

## 3. Load the plugin

At runtime call `load_plugin()` or `load_plugins_from_path()` to register the new functionality:

```cpp
#include <harmonics/plugin.hpp>
#include <iostream>

int main() {
    auto handles = harmonics::load_plugins_from_path("./build");
    std::cout << "Loaded " << handles.size() << " plugin(s)" << std::endl;
    const auto& act = harmonics::getActivation("example_act");
    harmonics::HTensor t{};
    act(t);
    harmonics::unload_plugins(handles);
}
```

Running the above program loads the plugin, invokes the custom activation and then unloads the shared library.

## 4. Automatic discovery

`load_plugins_from_path()` accepts a colon separated list of directories and scans them recursively for shared libraries. If called with an empty string it falls back to the `HARMONICS_PLUGIN_PATH` environment variable:

```bash
export HARMONICS_PLUGIN_PATH=/path/to/plugins:/other/path
my_program
```

Any libraries containing a `harmonics_register` function are loaded automatically.

## 5. Next steps

See [PluginSystem.md](PluginSystem.md) for a detailed reference of all helper functions including asynchronous loading and unloading.

# Plugin Packaging Guidelines

Plugins are distributed as shared libraries together with a small descriptor file. The loader scans directories recursively, so packaging all files in a single folder keeps installation simple.

## Directory layout

```
my_plugin/
  sample_plugin.so
  plugin.json
```

The optional `plugin.json` contains metadata such as the plugin name, version and any library dependencies. Applications may read this information before loading the library.
## Plugin Manifest

A plugin directory can include a `plugin.json` file with metadata that describes the library. Only the `name` and `version` fields are expected, but additional keys may be added by projects.

```json
{
  "name": "my_plugin",
  "version": "1.0"
}
```


Package the folder as a zip or tar archive for distribution (using zstd compression for tar):

```bash
tar --zstd -cf my_plugin.tar.zst my_plugin
# or
zip -r my_plugin.zip my_plugin
```

At runtime set the `HARMONICS_PLUGIN_PATH` environment variable to the location of the unpacked directory. `load_plugins_from_path()` will discover the library automatically.

## Packaging CLI

The `plugin_packager` tool automates creating and installing plugin archives. It uses the system `tar` command internally so no additional dependencies are required.

```bash
plugin_packager package my_plugin my_plugin.tar.zst
plugin_packager install my_plugin.tar.zst ~/.local/harmonics/plugins
```

The first command bundles the contents of `my_plugin` into the archive `my_plugin.tar.zst`. The second extracts the archive into the target directory. Set `HARMONICS_PLUGIN_PATH` to the folder containing the unpacked plugins so the runtime can load them at startup.

# Graph Diff and Merge

Changes between two graphs can be analysed and applied at runtime. The header `include/harmonics/graph_diff.hpp` provides helpers to compute a diff and merge graphs.

## API Overview

```cpp
auto diff = harmonics::diff_graphs(before, after);
harmonics::apply_diff(graph, diff);
auto merged = harmonics::merge_graphs(base, update);
```

`GraphDiff` lists added and removed layers as well as new or deleted flows. `apply_diff` modifies a graph in place while `merge_graphs` returns a new graph containing the updates.

## Command line tool

The `graph_diff` utility wraps these functions for serialized graphs:

```bash
graph_diff diff base.hgr update.hgr
graph_diff merge base.hgr update.hgr -o merged.hgr
```

`diff` prints the required edits to standard output. `merge` applies the changes from the second graph and writes the result to the file given by `-o` (or overwrites the first file when omitted).

# Graph Debugger

`graph_debugger` provides an interactive way to step through a compiled graph. It executes one arrow at a time and prints the source and destination nodes so you can observe the data flow.

## Usage

```bash
graph_debugger <graph> [--bits n]
```

The argument `<graph>` is a `.hgr` file produced by `harmonics_cli --compile`. The optional `--bits` flag selects the execution precision with `32` as the default.

Running the tool loads the graph, binds zero producers for each input and performs a single forward pass. For every arrow the program prints a line like:

```
source -> destination [shape]
```

Backward arrows are printed with `~>` instead of `->`. If the arrow was generated by a specific layer function, the name appears in parentheses. After printing, the debugger waits for you to press Enter before continuing to the next arrow.

## Example

```bash
graph_debugger model.hgr --bits 16
```

This prints each data flow and pauses, allowing you to verify that the graph executes in the expected order and with the correct tensor shapes.

# Graph Info CLI

The `graph_info` tool prints a summary of a serialized graph. It lists all
producers, layers and consumers followed by each data flow.

## Usage

```bash
graph_info <graph>
```

The output can be used to quickly inspect the structure of a compiled model.
Backward flows are printed with `~>` and layer function names appear in
parentheses.
